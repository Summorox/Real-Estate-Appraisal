# Real State Appraisal
## Overview
This repository contains a group project developed as part of a master's program in Artificial Intelligence at ISEP, completed in 2022. The project focuses on implementing expert systems and rule-based methodologies to assess real estate values based on their characteristics, providing a foundation for understanding and automating appraisal processes in a structured environment.

## Features

- **Expert System Logic**: Uses a rule-based system to evaluate and score property characteristics, to simulate the decision-making process of an expert.
- **Adaptable Rules**: The values within the rule set can be easily adjusted to account for regional variations in property prices.
- **Extensible Property Attributes**: New property attributes can be added to the database with only minor adjustments, allowing for the addition of attribute-price variance pairs as needed.
- **Dual Rule-Based Systems**: The rule-based system has been implemented in two distinct ways: one using Prolog and the other using Drools. Both implementations can be connected to a frontend via API, enabling a flexible appraisal interface.
- **User Interface**: A simple web interface allows users to input property details and receive appraisal results.

## Technologies Used
**Languages**: [Java](https://www.java.com/en/), [Prolog](https://www.swi-prolog.org/), HTML  
**Main Technologies**: [Drools](https://www.drools.org/), [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot/)
